# Cute Wheather 🌦️✨

Cute Wheather is a small, charming weather application that shows real-time weather conditions for your city — and wraps it all in a cute, pastel + cozy visual style that feels more like magic than data.  

## 🔎 What it does  
- Displays current weather (temperature, conditions, humidity, etc.) for a user‑defined location.  
- Updates background, icons and theme to match weather — turning boring data into a cozy vibe.  
- Works directly in the browser — no installations required, just open the link and see the weather with style.  

## 💡 Why I built it  
I wanted a weather app that didn’t feel cold and technical — something soft, aesthetic and personal.  
With Cute Wheather I mix my love for design, pastel‑colored UI, and simple, useful web tools.  
It’s also a playground for me to improve my HTML, CSS and basic JS skills while making something real.  


## 🧰 Technologies Used  
- HTML5  
- CSS3 (with responsive layout and custom styling)  
- JavaScript for fetching weather data and dynamic updates  

## ✨ What makes it special  
- Aesthetic‑first — the UI is soft, pastel, and user‑friendly.  
- Lightweight and frontend‑only — no backend, no database.  
- Deployed with GitHub Pages — easy to access and simple to share.
